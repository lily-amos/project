## Background

![](data-raw/wood-survey-data-master/neon-logo.png){width="300"}

The [woody plant vegetation structure](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.10098.001) dataset [@DP1.10098.001/provisional] contains the quality-controlled, native sampling resolution data from in-situ measurements of live and standing dead woody individuals and shrub groups, from all terrestrial NEON sites with qualifying woody vegetation. This protocol adopts guidelines established by the @forestry2012 for measuring tree species.

Our analyses focuses on the **relationship between individual stem heights and diameter** and how that relationship **varies across growth forms**.

### Data Preparation

The analytical dataset was prepared in the following ways:

-   Combined all data files into a single table
-   Geolocated individual stems by combining individual dataset with plot level data

Full data preparation steps can be found in the `data-raw/individuals.R` script.

## Summary Statistics

Prepared data were also subset to columns of interest `stem_diameter`, `height` and `growth_form` and records where `growth_form` values were not `"liana"` or missing.

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| code-fold: true
#| message: false

## Setup ----
## Load libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

## Load data
individual <- readr::read_csv(
  here::here("data", "individual.csv")
  ) %>% 
  select(stem_diameter, height, growth_form)

# Subset analysis data ----
analysis_df <- individual %>%
  filter(complete.cases(.), 
         growth_form != "liana")

## Order growth form levels
gf_levels <- table(analysis_df$growth_form) %>%
  sort() %>%
  names()

analysis_df <- analysis_df %>%
  mutate(growth_form = factor(growth_form,
                              levels = gf_levels
  ))

```

The final data set contains a total of `{r} nrow(analysis_df)`

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-print
analysis_df
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-growth-form-counts
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of individual counts across growth forms."

## Figure 1: Bar plot of growth forms
analysis_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = growth_form, colour = growth_form, fill = growth_form)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE)
```

@fig-growth-form-counts shows the distribution of individual counts across growth forms.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-violin-plots
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of log stem_diameter and log height across growth forms"
analysis_df %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(
    cols = c(stem_diameter, height),
    names_to = "var",
    values_to = "value"
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = log(value), y = growth_form,
    colour = growth_form, fill = growth_form
  )) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.5, trim = TRUE, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7, show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_grid(~var) +
  theme_linedraw()

```

@fig-violin-plots shows the log distribution of stem diameter and log height across growth forms.

# Analysis

## Relationship between log height and stem diameter

Initially we fit a linear model of form `log(stem_diameter)` as a function of `log(height)`.

```{r}
lm_overall <- lm(
  log(stem_diameter) ~ log(height),
  analysis_df
)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap: "Overall model evaluation"
#| label: tbl-overall-glance
library(gt)
lm_overall |> 
  broom::glance() |> 
  gt() |>
  fmt_number(decimals = 2)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap: "Overall model coefficents"
#| label: tbl-overall-tidy
library(gt)
lm_overall |> broom::tidy() |> 
  gt() |>
  fmt_number(decimals = 4) |>
  tab_style_body(
    columns = "p.value",
    style = cell_text(weight = "bold"),
    fn = function(x) x < 0.05
  )
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Relationship between stem diameter and height across all data."
#| label: fig-overall-lm
analysis_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = log(height), y = log(stem_diameter))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  xlab("Log of height (m)") +
  ylab("Log of stem diameter (cm)") +
  theme_linedraw()

```

See @fig-overall-lm, @tbl-overall-glance and @tbl-overall-tidy for results.

### Growth form level analysis

We also fit a model with an interaction term with growth form included.

```{r}
lm_growth <- lm(
  log(stem_diameter) ~ log(height) * growth_form,
  analysis_df
)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap: "Growth Form interaction model evaluation"
#| label: tbl-growth-glance
library(gt)
lm_growth |> broom::glance() |> gt() |>
  fmt_number(decimals = 2)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap: "Growth Form interaction model coefficents"
#| label: tbl-growth-tidy
library(gt)
lm_growth |> broom::tidy() |> gt() |>
  fmt_number(decimals = 4) |>
  tab_style_body(
    columns = "p.value",
    style = cell_text(weight = "bold"),
    fn = function(x) x < 0.05
  )
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Relationship between stem diameter and height across growth forms."
#| label: fig-growth-formlm
analysis_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = log(height), y = log(stem_diameter), colour = growth_form)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    x = "Log of height (m)",
    y = "Log of stem diameter (cm)",
    colour = "Growth forms"
  ) +
  theme_linedraw()
```

See @fig-growth-formlm, @tbl-growth-glance and @tbl-growth-tidy for results.

## Summary

Our results agree with findings in the literature [@Haase; @THORNLEY1999195; @CANNELL1984299].
